[] move lightwall place/resize logic into bike class
[] define player and bike logic -- controllable by player and AI
[] display fps and other debug info (player pos, velo, etc.) at top of window
[in progress] add main, play, death, pause, and settings screen states
[] implement local MP -- different key set for second player (arrow keys)
[] add powerups (increased/decreased movespeed, invincibility?)
[] add basic AI

[nope, want to be able to move freely] fix movement to a grid? try and get feel at least
[done, refactored everything from main.cpp] start refactoring (player class, etc.)

Refactoring
--------
- Entity class
	- Bike class
	- Lightwall class
- Screen
	- Game
	- Death
- Game

Refactoring notes
--------
- Entities
	- have a rectangle
		- x pos, y pos, width, height
	- have a velocity
	- can be drawn
	- can be removed (killed)
	- can be spawned
	- can be translated
	- can be resized

- Bike
	- have direction
	- movment

- Game
	- controls game flow (in particular, screens), main just creates the game
	- has an update and draw function, but just calls current screen's update/draw
