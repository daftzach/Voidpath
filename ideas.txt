Refactoring notes
--------
- Entities
	- have a rectangle
		- x pos, y pos, width, height
	- have a velocity
	- can be drawn
	- can be removed (killed)
	- can be spawned
	- can be translated
	- can be resized

- Bike
	- have direction
	- movment

- Game
	- controls game flow (in particular, screens), main just creates the game
	- has an update and draw function, but just calls current screen's update/draw
